# üè® Hotel Management Database ‚Äî Performance & Query Enhancements

## üîß What's New in This Commit

This update focuses on **database optimization** and the addition of **useful SQL queries and views** that reflect real-world hotel operations.

---

## üöÄ Index Optimization

To speed up read operations and improve the overall performance of the database, several indexes were added:


### üë§ Clients Table
- `document_number` ‚Äî used for quick lookups by passport or ID.
- `phone` ‚Äî helps find clients by phone number efficiently  

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_clients_document_number ON Clients(document_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_clients_phone ON Clients(phone);
```

---

### üõèÔ∏è Room Table

- `status_room` ‚Äî fast filtering for availability (free, reserved, maintenance).

- `comfort_level` ‚Äî helps search for room types (standard, deluxe, suite).

- `Composite index: comfort_level + status_room` ‚Äî improves queries filtering both.

- `price_room` ‚Äî useful for sorting and filtering by price.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_room_status ON Room(status_room);
CREATE INDEX idx_room_comfort ON Room(comfort_level);
CREATE INDEX idx_room_comfort_status ON Room(comfort_level, status_room);
CREATE INDEX idx_room_price ON Room(price_room);
```

---

### üë®‚Äçüíº Staff Table

- `job_title` ‚Äî improves queries by position (e.g. cleaners, receptionists).

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_staff_job ON Staff(job_title);
```

---

### üìÖ Booking Table

- `id_client` ‚Äî boosts join performance and filtering by client.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_boking_id_client ON Booking(id_client);
```

---

### üìä SQL Queries
Below are practical and efficient queries reflecting hotel operations.

### üü© Room Availability

```sql
SELECT r.number_room  
FROM Room r
WHERE r.status_room = 'free';
```

‚û°Ô∏è Find all currently available rooms.

---

### üßæ Active Reservations with Client Info

```sql
SELECT c.last_name, c.first_name, c.middle_name, r.number_room, b.date_check_in, b.date_check_out
FROM booking b
JOIN room r ON b.number_room = r.number_room
JOIN clients c ON b.id_client = c.id_client
WHERE b.status_booking = 'reservat';
``` 
‚û°Ô∏è Useful at reception to view all reserved rooms with check-in/out dates.

---

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Client Activity & Booking Stats
#### Last Booking Per Client
```sql
SELECT c.last_name, c.first_name, c.middle_name, MAX(b.date_reservation) AS last_booking_date
FROM clients c
LEFT JOIN booking b ON c.id_client = b.id_client
GROUP BY c.id_client;
``` 
--- 

#### Total Number of Bookings per Client

```sql
SELECT c.last_name, c.first_name, c.middle_name, COUNT(*) AS count_booking
FROM booking b
JOIN clients c ON c.id_client = b.id_client
GROUP BY c.id_client;
```

s.price_services, (s.price_services * bs.quantity) AS total_summ
FROM booking b
JOIN clients c ON b.id_client = c.id_client
JOIN room r ON b.number_room = r.number_room
JOIN booking_services bs ON b.id_booking = bs.id_booking
JOIN servicess s ON bs.id_services = s.id_services
WHERE b.id_booking = 1;
```

---

#### Most Popular Services
```sql
SELECT s.name_services, SUM(bs.quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM servicess s
JOIN booking_services bs ON s.id_services = bs.id_services
GROUP BY s.id_services
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### üè® Room Usage and Maintenance
#### Booked Suites
```sql
SELECT c.last_name, c.first_name, c.middle_name, r.number_room, b.date_check_in, r.comfort_level
FROM booking b
JOIN clients c ON b.id_client = c.id_client
JOIN room r ON b.number_room = r.number_room
WHERE r.comfort_level = 'suite';
```

---

#### Maintenance + Free Room Insights (with last bookings)
```sql
SELECT r.number_room, r.status_room, MAX(b.date_reservation) AS date_last_booking, MAX(m.end_date) AS date_last_maintenance
FROM room r
LEFT JOIN booking b ON r.number_room = b.number_room
LEFT JOIN maintenance m ON r.number_room = m.number_room
WHERE r.status_room = 'maintenance'
GROUP BY r.number_room

UNION

SELECT r.number_room, r.status_room, MAX(b.date_reservation), NULL
FROM room r
JOIN booking b ON r.number_room = b.number_room
WHERE r.status_room = 'free'
GROUP BY r.number_room;
```
